# LazyLoading - demo app

This project was created to show lazy loading feature in Angular. This is demo application created for my presentation delivered on Angular Warsaw Meetup on 2018-01-18

## How to run the code

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
